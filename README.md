C++ implementation of [Alexander](https://github.com/wynnliam/alexander).

The overarching vision of this is to be a game like Total War or Europa Universalis 4.
However, in the meantime, this will be the following:

* A multithreaded game engine
* Flock/Boid simulator

I want to build it from the ground up, unlike Unity, because I think I can have more control
over the structure. I want to place heavy emphasis on effeciency. Ideally I will be able to
process several entities on a tiny machine.
